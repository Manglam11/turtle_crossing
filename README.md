# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game (Python)

A fun and interactive **Turtle Crossing Game** built using **Python Turtle Graphics** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
The goal is to help the turtle safely cross the road while avoiding moving cars. With every successful crossing, the difficulty increases.
